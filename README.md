# Life360 Ads SDK (Android)

The  Life360 Ads SDK is an extension of the open-source [Prebid Mobile Android](https://github.com/prebid/prebid-mobile-android) project. It adds Nativo as a competing demand source alongside Prebid, with the winning bid sent to Google Ad Manager (GAM) for final decisioning. For base Prebid Mobile concepts and API documentation, refer to the [official Prebid Mobile documentation](https://docs.prebid.org/prebid-mobile/pbm-api/android/code-integration-android.html).

## Features

### Nativo Ad Request Pipeline
An additional bid request is sent to Nativo as a demand source competing alongside Prebid Server. The SDK compares all bids and sends the winning bid to GAM, or other ad server.

### Owned & Operated Ads
Direct ad campaigns through Nativo are supported via an `isOwnedOperated` flag. When set, the ad bypasses the auction and is rendered immediately without going through Prebid Server or GAM.

### Nativo Ad Types
Rendering support for all unique Nativo ad formats, including types not natively supported by Prebid.

### Full-width Ad Rendering
The `NativoRenderer` plugin handles dynamic expansion of ad creatives to full width/height using constraint-based layout, ensuring correct display across varying screen sizes.

### Geo/Location Data with Nativo
When a developer sets `shareGeoLocationWithNativo` to `true` and the user grants location permission, the SDK conditionally appends ORTB `geo` parameters to the Nativo bid request.

### GAM Click Attribution for 3rd party ads (Nativo & Prebid)
When using GAM as the ad server, clicks within a Nativo or Prebid ad are tracked back into the GAM platform, ensuring accurate click attribution and reporting.

## Improvements & Bug Fixes

Relative to the upstream Prebid Mobile, this SDK includes the following fixes and improvements:

- **Viewability Tracking** — Scroll-based viewability tracking replacing the upstream poll-based approach, for more accurate measurement
- **MRAID Expand** — Improved MRAID expand support with better animations and no glitching
- **iframe Handling** — Within expanded ad content, fix to allow iframes to load
- **Ad Refresh Handling** — Fix for ad refresh lifecycle management
- **bURL Tracker** — Fix for auction macro replacement in billing URL tracking
- **Rendering** — `PBMWebView` background color fixes
- **GAM Event Handlers** — Click and impression callbacks for GAM-rendered ads

## Ad Request Flow

The SDK orchestrates the following 9-step flow for each ad request:

1. SDK sends a bid request to Nativo
2. SDK checks for an Owned & Operated signal — if present, skip to step 9
3. SDK sends a bid request to Prebid Server
4. Prebid Server runs the header bidding auction across configured demand partners
5. SDK compares all bids (Nativo + Prebid) and selects the highest price, setting targeting keywords accordingly
6. (If using GAM) GMA SDK sends a request to GAM for final decisioning
7. (If using GAM) GMA SDK renders the winning bid (if GAM's own ad wins, the flow ends here)
8. (If using GAM) If a Prebid or Nativo bid wins, GAM serves a passback creative signaling the SDK to take over rendering
9. The SDK rendering module renders the winning bid

## Repackaging

All public classes in this SDK are published under the `com.life360.ads` namespace rather than the upstream `org.prebid.mobile` namespace. The repackaging is done at build time using [JarJar](https://github.com/eed3si9n/jarjar-maven-plugin) — source files stay on `org.prebid.mobile` so the branch remains easy to merge with upstream Prebid releases.

The rule is defined in [`PrebidMobile/jarjar-rules.txt`](PrebidMobile/jarjar-rules.txt):


## Build from Source

To produce the repackaged `com.life360.ads` artifacts for all modules, run:

```
scripts/buildPrebidMobile-life.sh
```

Output JARs and AARs are written to `generated/`. To skip JAR extraction and only produce the repackaged AARs, pass `-nojar`:

```
scripts/buildPrebidMobile-life.sh -nojar
```


## Testing

Run unit tests and integration tests with:

```
scripts/testPrebidMobile.sh
```

## FAQ

**Does the  Life360 Ads SDK use OMID / OMSDK?**

Yes, but the SDK is not currently IAB certified. Without certification, the demand-side benefits of OMID measurement are not fully realized unless the publisher obtains their own certification.

**Does the  Life360 Ads SDK support multi-format bidding?**

Not currently. The SDK uses Prebid Rendering (rather than Bidding-only with GAM rendering), which does not support multi-format bidding at this time. This is an area of future exploration.
